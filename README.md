# About files in this directory

- This is a [README.md](README.md) file. It sits in the base of the repo and gives a general orientation. Because this file is written in (Github-flavored) [*markdown*](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax), Github can render it nicely.
- [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file tells how your repo can be used by others.
- [.gitignore](.gitignore) file tells Git not to commit certain files. It's important to make sure you don't make private information like passwords, private keys, API keys, and sensitive data public. Git contains the entire history of the repo, so if you delete a file that has been committed, the file can be recovered from the repo.
